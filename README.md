## Research Projects
#### 1. The effect of Fast Flicker Adaptation on Contrast Discrimination (Dissertation)
My dissertation dives into interactions between the spatial and temporal domains of the visual system. My experiments delve into Fast Flicker Adaptation (FFAd) and its impact on resolving fine details in static objects. I focus on the magnocellular (M) pathway, hypothesizing its crucial role in processing fast flickering and detailed imagery. My experiments span across three areas: examining contrast responses under varying contrasts of adapting flicker, understanding the influence of spatial frequency (details) in flickering stimuli, and analyzing the effects of different flicker speeds.

- Stimuli used in Exp1
  - Adaptation Stimuli and Procedure.
    (a) Brightness Profiles over 2 cycles for conditions for conditions 10C-F (10% Michelson contrast, left) and 50C-F (50% Michelson contrast, right) with a 50% temporal modulation on an 85 Hz monitor.
    (b) Procedure: each session begins with a 30-second adaptation to 1 of 4 contrast conditions, depicted through 8 images. Subsequent trials involve a 3-second adaptation, except the first trial of a new condition, which has a 15-second adaptation. After each adaptation, there's a 1-second pause with an auditory cue before presenting the test stimulus for 106 ms. Participants then choose which of the two displayed Gabor patches (sinusoidal gratings) has higher contrast, using a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) method.

- Stimuli used in Exp2
    (a) Adaptation stimulus with Gaussian low-pass filtering (top left) and its corresponding power spectrum (top right), which peaks at frequencies below 15 cycles per inch (cpi), or 2 cycles per degree (cpd).
    (b) Adaptation stimulus with band-pass filtering (bottom left) and its corresponding power spectrum (bottom right), peaking at around 50 cpi, or 6.3 cpd, illustrating the targeted spatial frequency ranges for this test.

#### 2. Examining Increment Thresholds as a Function of Pedestal Contrast under Hypothetical Parvo- and Magnocellular-biased Conditions
In our recent studies, we challenge existing views on how our visual system processes contrast and color. Traditionally, it was believed that two testing methods, the pulsed- and steady-pedestal paradigms, could separately measure the responses of the parvocellular (P) and magnocellular (M) systems in our eyes. These systems help us perceive largely details and movement, respectively. We investigated these methods by examining how well we can detect changes in contrast, especially under different light and color conditions. Surprisingly, our results showed that color doesn’t affect how we see contrast as much as previously thought, and that spatial frequency has minimal impact. Using a mathematical model, we found that both testing methods seem to measure the P-system more than the M-system.

#### 3. The influence of “advancing” and “receding” colors on figure-ground perception under monocular and binocular viewing
This study focuses on figure-ground perception, challenging the widely accepted idea that chromatic aberrations are the sole cause of red images appearing nearer or as the figure. I believe that a more comprehensive understanding of low-level optical and high-level cognitive processes involved in figure-ground/depth perception is necessary to fully account for this perceptual bias.
